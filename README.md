# Supply Chain Data Warehouse Bus Architecture

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a robust data warehouse bus architecture tailored for the supply chain industry. It encompasses five critical business processes: 

- **Sales**
- **Product Performance**
- **Payment Tracking**
- **Shipment Tracking**
- **Inventory Management**

Leveraging Power BI, I have created comprehensive dashboards for each process, enabling in-depth analysis and actionable insights. The goal is to provide a unified data model that integrates multiple business functions, facilitating streamlined operations and enhanced decision-making capabilities.

## Business Processes

1. **Sales Process**  
   Analyzes sales data to evaluate transaction performance and customer purchasing behavior.

2. **Product Performance Process**  
   Monitors monthly performance metrics to assess product sales and profitability over time, aiding in strategic product decisions.

3. **Payment Tracking Process**  
   Tracks the payment lifecycle, providing insights from initiation through to completion.

4. **Shipment Tracking Process**  
   Offers visibility into the status of shipments throughout the supply chain, from order dispatch to delivery.

5. **Inventory Management Process**  
   Manages daily inventory data to optimize stock levels and replenishment cycles, minimizing stockouts and overstock situations.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI**: Utilized for data analysis and visualization, creating intuitive dashboards that present clear insights for stakeholders.

- **Python**: Employed to create and process data, generating metrics necessary for the business processes while ensuring accuracy through calculated methods.

- **DAX Queries**: Used for creating calculated columns and measures in Power BI, enabling sophisticated data analysis and reporting.

- **Data Warehousing**: The project employs a bus architecture model to integrate multiple business processes through conformed dimensions.

## Dashboards & Presentation

The visual insights derived from this data warehouse are compiled into a PowerPoint presentation. Each dashboard is dedicated to a specific business process, offering actionable insights designed to improve operations and facilitate decision-making within the supply chain.

## Data Source

The dataset utilized for this project is derived from the **DataCo SMART SUPPLY CHAIN FOR BIG DATA ANALYSIS**, available on Mendeley Data. It encompasses information related to sales, products, payments, shipments, and inventory. Notably, while the dataset did not have all metrics for the mentioned business processes, the data was generated with careful calculations to ensure accuracy.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how an integrated data warehouse architecture can provide deep insights into the supply chain industry. By leveraging Power BI for reporting and analysis, along with Python for data processing and DAX queries for advanced calculations, the architecture supports better decision-making across sales, product performance, payments, shipments, and inventory management.

The presentation and dashboards offer a clear visualization of the findings, making it easier for decision-makers to act on insights.
